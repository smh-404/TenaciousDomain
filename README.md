# TenaciousDomain
This is a security tool to analyze domains in-depth. This is done by gathering as much information about the domain and its associated assets, and then performing analysis on the collected data to create a visual report highlighting security risks and concerns.


The python script uses a shodan api which you must include in the getOpenPorts function.
